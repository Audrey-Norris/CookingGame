### Scope:
This Game Design Document is supposed to help artists and developers familiarize themselves with the concepts for this game.


### Summary:
What if instead of creating armor and weapons from monsters like in Monster Hunter, you cooked them instead! Manage your time between fighting monsters and helping the town to defeat a powerful curse over the land. Cook, fight, build and talk to build up your reputation and make a difference. The twist is that your character wasn't exactly willing at the start but was the only one up to the challenge.
