Cooking game is a game that balances management of a town with going out and battling monsters to protect the town.

You arrive at the town where an evil magical curse has befell the people causing monsters to over run the town and the people to be unable to do anything about it. Since you have a natural resistance to the plague and a knack for cooking you defeat the enemies and help rebuild the town through your cooking!


This game was based off the concept of Monster Hunter but cooking.

Ted’s Questions:

  

In this game you’ll take on the role of an adventuring cook who arrives at a town plagued by monsters. Using your skills you defeat the monsters but need something to do with them, so in an effort to help the town rebuild and regain strength you cook them! Manage your time effectively as you talk with residents, battle, learn and cook to defeat the monsters once and for all!

  

1. What does the player do when playing? How does this make them feel physically and emotionally?

The player is collecting materials to be able to create new items to forward their goals in the game. The collection would be satisfying and challenging because you have to get the items from monsters.

  

2. What is the game about? How does the game present this to the player?

The game is about community and finding your own adventure. The game presents this through allowing the player to create diverse and interesting recipes and finding their own preferences for how they do it. Cooking is a uniting and communal activity and I want that to be present in the game.

  

3. What type of challenge does the game present?

Management challenge or collecting challenge along with strategy. The player will either have to balance all of their responsibilities properly or go out of their way to find interesting things and collect items along the way. Combat will be based on choices and so monsters will have to be thought about carefully to be defeated. Management of time will be more likely.

  

4. Who is the player? Where are they encountering the game? How did they find out about it? When are they playing it? Why are they playing it? 

Our age demographic, on steam or gamejolt, they found out hopefully through advertising and word of mouth. Playing it to have fun overcoming challenges and making fun dishes.
